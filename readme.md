This is a little overlay that's designed to complementthe Mate desktop on Gentoo by providing some essential utilities and apps that are missing from portage. These are all apps that I personally use on my systems, and whatever I need at any given time will dictate what's in here. I'm sharing it as a courtesy only, and apps will come and go as things break or I stop using them. You're welcome to use it if you want, but understand that I don't support it and nothing is guaranteed to work for you. If you want to use it, it's recommended that you set ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~arch" globally to avoid a lot of headache.

To add it to your system execute the following as root.
